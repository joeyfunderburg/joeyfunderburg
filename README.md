- 👋 Hi, I’m @joeyfunderburg
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming, Art, and everything chronically online.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program using different programming languages, how computer components work, and how to schedule my work in such a way that doesn't completely kill me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mostly websites and Java/Python programs at the moment!
- 📫 How to reach me - my main email is joeyfunderburg@gmail.com, and my school email is jrf4648@email.vccs.edu! Will probably add more in the future.

Geese can be cool too.
