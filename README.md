- Hi, I’m @joeyfunderburg
- I’m interested in Gaming, Art, and learning how to better code in general.
- I’m currently learning how to program using different programming languages, how computer components work, and how to schedule my work in such a way that doesn't completely kill me.

It is kind of a sin to bring the beast up and not show him, so here he is.
